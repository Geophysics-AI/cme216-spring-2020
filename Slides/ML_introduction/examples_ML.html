# Foundations of machine learning

---
class: middle

Machine learning relies on many disciplines in mathematics and statistics, such as 

- statistical modeling, 
- computational statistics, 
- optimization

Tom Mitchell in [_Machine Learning_](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/3427993) provides a
formal definition of the concept of learning by computer programs (page
2).

_Definition:_ A computer program is said to learn from experience _E_ with respect to some class of tasks _T_ and performance measure _P_ if its performance at tasks in _T_, as measured by _P_, improves with experience _E_.

Please read section 5.1.1-3 in [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) for examples of tasks in machine learning.

The key in this definition is that the accuracy of our prediction improves with _E_, for example, if we acquire more data (increase $m$ above) or improve the quality of the data (if we assume that the data is noisy or somehow corrupted).

This is therefore qualitatively different from the previous approach described at the beginning, based on
deriving and applying general physical laws. 

**Machine learning is, therefore, most effective when deriving such laws or mathematical model _a priori_ (that is in the absence of data) is difficult.**

We focus on applications of deep learning, e.g., using deep neural networks, since this is the focus of this class.
