title: Partial Solutions to Reading Assignments 21-24
---

Here are the solutions to trickier questions from these reading assignments.

RA21 Q1: The form of the function is already given, what we want to determine are the coefficients, hence this is a parameter inverse problem.

RA21 Q3: In general, we cannot express a DNN as a linear combination of basis functions, due to the presence of non-linear activations.

RA21 Q4: In each dimension, we need $$ \frac{1}{h} $$ elements; since there are d dimensions, we need $$ \frac{1}{h^d} $$ elements total.
