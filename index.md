title: Stanford cme 216 Lecture notes
---

These are lecture note for CME 216 Machine Learning in Computational Engineering. They were written by [Eric Darve](https://me.stanford.edu/people/eric-darve), with the [help](https://github.com/EricDarve/cme216-spring-2020/commits/master) of course staff and students.
{% include marginnote.html id='mn-construction' note='The notes are **under construction**! Although we have written up most of the material, you will probably find several typos. If you do, please let us know, or submit a pull request with your fixes to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EricDarve/cme216-spring-2020).'%} The Jekyll theme is inspired by the [CS228 lecture notes](https://github.com/ermongroup/cs228-notes) site on GitHub.
