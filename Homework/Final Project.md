title: Final Project
---

At the end of the quarter, you are expected to submit a 5-page report on a final project of your choosing. The report for your project should involve at least the following components:

1. 5 points. Description of the engineering topic you chose; the choice of topics is open but it should be related to an engineering problem, rather than a pure computer science topic, such as image or speech.1. 5 points. Describe the problem of interest and its difficulties.
1. 10 points. Review the published literature and available approaches that are relevant to your problem.
1. 10 points. Propose and describe the algorithm that you picked to solve your problem. This should be preferably a published method or a known technique that has been tested and "validated" before, in order to limit last-minute surprises. It is best to focus on methods covered during this quarter such as support vector machines, deep neural networks, physics-informed neural networks, etc.
1. 20 points. Implement your method using your language and framework of choice. You can use TensorFlow or PyTorch. Reusing existing code is fine but you must cite your sources and describe the changes and additions you have made to the code. Turn in your code with your assignment.
1. 5 points. Choose and describe the datasets, problem settings and parameters that you used for your code development, testing, and benchmarks.
1. 5 points. Describe the steps you have taken to verify that your code is correctly implementing the algorithm.
1. 10 points. Plot and present the results of your benchmarks. Discuss and interpret the results. Make sure you explore a range of inputs and algorithm parameters to give a good sense of how the method performs.
1. 5 points. Discuss the limitations of the proposed approach and some ideas to improve it.

We recommend to keep it simple. Start with a modest project and clearly achievable goals. Then if all goes well, you can add "bonus" results. It is better to start simple and add later, than start with an ambitious goal and then abandon it for something much simpler at the last minute.

We will ask you to submit the following intermediate report. You should formulate an intermediate project goal, called Milestone 1. This is to make sure that you pace yourself and are on track for a good report at the end. Milestone 1 typically consists of some preliminary computer program, and early validation of your implementation at this point. This is an intermediate stage in the development of the full project.

1. Due date: February 13, 11 PM. One-page report containing: description of the problem you have chosen, sample literature, detailed description of Milestone 1.
1. Due date: February 27, 11 PM. Two-page report containing: report and results for Milestone 1. Turn in your report and code.

Final project due date: March 20th, 11 PM.

We advise you to try to complete most of the work by March 13th, and keep the last week to focus on the written report.
