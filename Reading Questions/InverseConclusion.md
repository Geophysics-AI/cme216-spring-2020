The next questions refer to video "5.6 Training Methods: Physics Constrained Learning."

See also slides 44 to 47 for examples of applications of ADCME.

1. Which methods apply when observations are sparse?
1. Which methods do not require optimizing over the state variable $u$?
1. Between TensorFlow (TF) eager and TensorFlow graph, which one has the best performance in terms of AD capabilities?
1. Beside ADCME, is there a Julia library which offers AD capabilities? Which one is it?
1. How does the performance of PyTorch compare with TF eager and TF graph?
1. What are the four training algorithms we covered in this module? See slide 50.
